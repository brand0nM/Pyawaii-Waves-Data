# Pyawaii-Waves-Data
## Project Overview
We've been hired to create a mobile app that tracks weather data and filters results locally. 

### Purpose
With a SQLite databases use SQLalchemy to query the local data.

## Analysis
After creating an engine and inspecting the tables/columns, one can use SQLalchemy's query or session function to analyse the data; query allows for standard sql queries and session requires python. In this project we used sesssion to gather data from the measurements table.

## Results
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)
